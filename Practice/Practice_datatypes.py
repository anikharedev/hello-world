## Practice Data Types

## Whenever we want to use data, we declare and assign it to a "variable", in this case, my_city
my_city = "New York"

print ("I live in", my_city)

current_floor = 6
destination_floor = 6

if (current_floor < destination_floor):
    print ("You need to go up")
elif (current_floor > destination_floor):
    print ("You need to go down")
elif (current_floor == destination_floor):
    print ("You are at the destination")
